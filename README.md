### Question 1 (15 points)
Using the spatial coordinates from your project dataset, simulate a spatial process with known parameters that includes at least one regression term. First describe a process to fit the parameters from that model, then fit the model and describe the results.

### Question 2 (10 points)
Follow the instructions from Hillary Parker to create your first R Package. [https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) Your package may include more details, but it should also contain a function that simulates a spatial process using the coordinates in your project dataset. Make sure to include the documentation using `roxygen2`. To verify that your package works, load your package using `devtools install_github()` and run your data simulation step.
